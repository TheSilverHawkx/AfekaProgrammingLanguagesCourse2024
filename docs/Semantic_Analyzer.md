# Semantic Analyzer

The semantic analyzer performs checks on the AST to ensure that the code is semantically correct. This includes scope checking, type checking, and ensuring that variables are declared before they are used.

The analyzer traverses the AST and checks for any semantic errors that could cause the code to behave unexpectedly at runtime.
