# Token

A token is a sequence of characters that forms a syntactic unit within the code. The `Token` class represents these units and includes information about the type of token (such as `IDENTIFIER`, `NUMBER`, etc.) and the value associated with it.

Tokens are essential for the parser, which uses them to construct the AST.
