```python
Dr. Sharon Yalov-Handzel
squared = []
for even in evens:
squared.append(even**2)
sum_squared = 0
for x in squared:
sum_squared += x
print(sum_squared)
6.) Write one-line function that accepts as an input a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list containing the number of palindrome strings in each sublist. Use nested filter / map / reduce functions.
7.) Explain the term "lazy evaluation" in the context of the following program:
def generate_values():
print('Generating values...')
yield 1
yield 2
yield 3
def square(x):
print(f'Squaring {x}')
return x * x
print('Eager evaluation:')
values = list(generate_values())
squared_values = [square(x) for x in values]
print(squared_values)
```
In the provided program, lazy evaluation is demonstrated by the generate_values() function with 'yield'. This approach only computes and returns values when they are requested, which in this case happens during the iteration in the list comprehension. We can see this since each number is generated and immediately squared one at a time, showing on-demand calculation rather than calculating all values in advance.
