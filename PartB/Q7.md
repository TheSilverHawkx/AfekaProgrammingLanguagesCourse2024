In the provided program, lazy evaluation is demonstrated by the generate_values() function with 'yield'. This approach only computes and returns values when they are requested, which in this case happens during the iteration in the list comprehension. We can see this since each number is generated and immediately squared one at a time, showing on-demand calculation rather than calculating all values in advance.
